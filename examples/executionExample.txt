## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept
Can a particular Economy fare be fully booked?
No. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .

Can the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?
The fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.

Why doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?
Group bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.

Can the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?
The additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.

Is it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?
Wenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.

What do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?
Tarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.

What do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?
Im Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.

What are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?
The number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.

If I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?
Like the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.

If I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?
No; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.

What is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?
The 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.

With the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?
The first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.

If I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?
No; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.

How many additional items of baggage can I purchase?
You can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.

SWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?
Applies to "Economy Flex" and "Business Flex" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.



================================== Ai Message ==================================

Yes, you are allowed to update your flight to an earlier or later time, provided your ticket meets the standard rebooking requirements (such as not being part of a package, a group booking, or already checked in, among others).

You are looking to depart later today, so I can help you search for available flights from Paris (CDG) to Basel (BSL) that leave sooner than your current schedule. Would you like me to look for flights departing this evening? If you have a preferred time window, please let me know!
